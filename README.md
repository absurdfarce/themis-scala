# Porting Themis to Scala

An experiment in using [Augment](https://www.augmentcode.com/) to port [Themis](https://github.com/absurdfarce/themis) to Scala.

## Chat version
First attempt was to use the chat functionality in Augment.  The output of this process can be found [here](chat).  A transcript of the entire conversation between myself and Augment can be found [here](chat/transcript/themis-scala.txt).
